# 🗡️ Kill Command

The `kill` command is used to **send signals to processes**, typically to terminate or control them.

```bash
kill [options] <PID>
```

📌 Replace `<PID>` with the Process ID of the target process.

## 🚦 Common `kill` Usage Examples

### 💤 Graceful Termination — `SIGTERM` (Signal 15)

```bash
kill 123
```

✅ Politely asks the process to terminate.
*Allows the process to clean up before exiting.*

---

### 🪓 Force Kill — `SIGKILL` (Signal 9)

```bash
kill -9 123
```

💥 **Immediate termination**.
*Doesn’t allow cleanup — use only when necessary.*
🗡️ *Think of it as the "katana" of kill commands.*

---

### ⌨️ Interrupt — `SIGINT` (Signal 2)

```bash
kill -2 123
```

🛑 Mimics pressing `Ctrl + C`.
*Often used to stop processes gracefully from the terminal.*

---

### 🔄 Hangup — `SIGHUP` (Signal 1)

```bash
kill -1 123
```

♻️ Requests the process to **reload or restart**.
*Commonly used for daemons or services to reload configs.*
